# Auto-Learn Introduction
Auto-Learn is a machine learning Android application for our CSE3310: Fundamentals of Software Engineering class taken in Spring 2020. 

GitHub was used to host our git repository, it contains the following items:

* **AutoLearnApp** - Android studio project
* **Documentation** - Project Documentation
* **Machine Learning** - Dataset and ML material

# AutoLearnApp
### Prerequisites
* **Android Studio** must be installed ([Installation Instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio))

### Cloning the repository
From the cmd prompt or PowerShell type in the instruction 
**git clone https://github.com/willpanderson/Auto-Learn.git**

# Documentation
* **UML diagrams** - located inside of **Increment1_UML**
* **System Requirements Analysis** - located inside of **Increment2_SRA**
* **Test Plan** - located inside of **Increment3_TPL**
* **Final Documentation** - located in **Increment4_Final Binder**

# Machine Learning
### Data_Set
Contains a zipped folder **car_images.zip** which contains six folders representing our **six classifications**.
This is the dataset that was used to train the machine learning model generated by **FirebaseAutoML Vision Edge API**
* [AutoML Vision documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs)

### TF_Model
Contains a google Collab with the code for our custom machine learning model. This model is currently being developed.
